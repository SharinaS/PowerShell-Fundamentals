My collection of cheatsheets, code, notes and resources created while learning PowerShell

## Types of PowerShell

Powershell core – newer. Does not come with Windows by default. Can do nearly all the same stuff. Allows us to run commands on multiple platforms, unlike Powershell. Based on .netcore. Downloadable from GitHub. Can be run on Windows, Linux and MacOS. The future way of working with PS. An open source project. Only has a subset of Windows PS commands, but it’s a large subset. To open in computer, can type “pwsh 

Windows Powershell ISE – integrated scripting engine. The original built in editor for editing PS scripts. Comes installed by default.  

Windows Powershell - most popular. Built into Windows. Only on windows; can’t install or run on mac or linux. Based on the .net standard, using the .net framework that PS is built on. Development has stopped for Windows Powershell (no further updates, except for security stuff). 

## Objects
